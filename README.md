This is what got me back into coding after a long break, it started off as absolute spaghetti code and probably still is a little poorly done. However a few months after I originally wrote it all, I remembered it and thought about how easy it would've been to fix it from where it was, even though it worked I feared it just looked horrible. It still has a lot of missing features but I wanted to explore a very simplified version of a "To-Do" list but with a sense of reward. This is something that has always interested me, the idea of an "RPG" system for real life tasks, a sense of levelling up in those specific tasks. The rewards in it's current state are very minimal and unrewarding. This taught me how to create a project from scratch, the inception of an idea and figuring out the start point can be hard but I managed it. It taught me how to apply very simple but applicable maths in a system, such as calculating how much experience points are needed to level up, and how much experience to give for a certain amount of time. This is my start of creating something from my brain and writing down into code. This also taught me how to seperate my scripts and interact between themselves.

How to use:

All inputs are case sensitive, some inputs require numbers, some require words.

1. Open the "Main" file. Entering your profile name, if it exists, type it as it was originally. If it doesn't exist, type it however you want and remember it.
2.What do you want to do? Type the number that shows up in the debug for what you want to do. (E.g. in case of "1.View XP", type 1 to view XP)
3. Follow the instructions, if it is "working" that you are doing you will be prompted with telling the program what is it that you are doing and how hard it is to do if it's a new thing you are working on. If you are in the store you will be able to sell all of your items
    or specific items.
