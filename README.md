This is a very simple, and slightly old thing I worked on a few years ago. I was very proud of it when I created it. Just run the "Main" file to play around with it.

How to use:

All inputs are case sensitive, some inputs require numbers, some require words.

1. Open the "Main" file. Entering your profile name, if it exists, type it as it was originally. If it doesn't exist, type it however you want and remember it.
2.What do you want to do? Type the number that shows up in the debug for what you want to do. (E.g. in case of "1.View XP", type 1 to view XP)
3. Follow the instructions, if it is "working" that you are doing you will be prompted with telling the program what is it that you are doing and how hard it is to do if it's a new thing you are working on. If you are in the store you will be able to sell all of your items
    or specific items.
